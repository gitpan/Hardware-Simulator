brief description
==================

Hardware::Simulator implements a hardware descriptor language in perl.
It is similar in functionality to VHDL or Verilog.
Hardware::Simulator allows simulation of parallel hardware components
in time. It can be used to model high-level or 
system-level architectures in behavioural language.
Currently, it is not well suited for gate level
simulation. This will improve as PHDL moves from
Alpha release to Beta, and finally to version 1.0

Any requests for new features will be added and any 
bugs reported will be fixed and the module will be 
re-released as soon as time permits.
